# What I Learnt
1. User-Centric Design Matters
Designing with the end-user in mind is paramount. Prioritize a clean and intuitive user interface to ensure that visitors can easily navigate through the website. User feedback, usability testing, and responsive design are crucial elements for a positive user experience.

2. Clear Communication is Key
Effectively communicating the department's information, events, and resources requires clarity and conciseness. Craft compelling and informative content while maintaining a balance to avoid overwhelming users with excessive information.

3. Mobile Responsiveness is a Standard
With the prevalence of mobile devices, ensure that the website is responsive and functions well across various screen sizes. Mobile-friendly design enhances accessibility and user engagement.

Building the Computer Science Department's website has been an insightful journey. These lessons learned not only apply to the realm of web development but also contribute to the overall success of the department's online presence. May this README serve as a guide for future enhancements and improvements. Thank you for being part of this exciting endeavor!
